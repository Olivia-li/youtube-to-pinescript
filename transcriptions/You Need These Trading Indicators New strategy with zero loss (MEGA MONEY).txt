hello everyone
in this video I want to share a simple
yet very profitable strategy with you
guys
by mastering this strategy do not
underestimate this strategy because of
its simplicity
you've only the other ones anymore
I will go through everything step by
step and try to teach you each and every
detail
so be sure to watch the whole video
first of all open the tradingview.com
website and then select the zoohouse
currency pair
now I'll set my time to the five minute
time frame for this strategy
but keep in mind that you can use this
method on all time frames and this
strategy can be profitable on all of
them
now it's time to add indicators to our
chart
in total three free indicators are going
to be used in this strategy
let's get to applying the first one
open the indicators tab from the top of
the page in trading View
then on the top of the tab in the search
bar we type our first indicator's name
which is Trader XL
we add this Trader XL micro Trend
scanner made by BTC trolley indicator
Trend charts now as you can see
Trader XO micro Trend scanner is an
indicator with simple and clear buy and
sell signals that we're going to use
them to trade
this indicator contains two moving
average graphs
these two lines here this one below is
the fast moving average graph and the
one on the top is the slow graph
the trading signals given by the
indicator are based on the crossing of
these two lines
if the crossing is upwards then it will
give us a bullish or by signal
or for example like here if the crossing
is downward it will show a bearish or
sell signal
now how do we trade using this indicator
as I said this is a simple trading
indicator which is very easy to use
and if you consider only two conditions
you can trade with this indicator alone
the two conditions are the appearance of
a bullish or long signal and the
candlesticks form simultaneously with
the signal being above the two lines
so whenever these conditions are met you
can enter the trade where the trigger
Candlestick is closed and make profit
you could have had an astounding profit
from this trade
also for the sell signals the conditions
are exactly the opposite
if a beer signal appears alongside a
Candlestick which is closed under both
of the moving average lines
all conditions are fulfilled and we can
enter the trade where the trigger
Candlestick has been closed and gained
profit without any problem
let me show you some more examples on
different time frames
to prove that this indicator is really
precise and effective let's check out
the 15 minutes time frame
see here
even in this time frame the indicator
has given us a Buy Signal at the best
point possible
if we had entered the trade using this
signal as you can see we could have
caught a very big movement of the market
this big movement of the market could
have been snatched by using this by
signal and we could have gained a lot of
profits and had an amazing trade
here we got a sell signal and the
Candlestick has been closed under the
moving average lines
so we can enter the trade here and open
a short selling position where the
candlesticks has been closed
again the trade could have made a lot of
profit for us just with the help of this
indicator alone
but if we use this indicator alone we
could face some problems same as the
other indicators that when the market
enters the reindeer Zone like here in
this situation we will get some fake
signals
for instance this signal here is fake or
this one over here and also this one is
fake as well
we can eliminate all of these fake
signals using the methods that I'm going
to introduce later on this video
but before moving on to that if you're
enjoying this video make sure to hit a
like And subscribe and help the Channel
with the algorithm
okay now let me teach you how to filter
these take signals
we need to add another indicator to our
charts
on top of the page click on the
indicators option and open the tab
on the search bar type macd and apply
the moving average convergence
Divergence indicator to your charts by
clicking on it
now this is how the indicator looks and
it contains some histograms and a signal
line and macd line
to make most of the indicator
we must open the settings of the
indicator and change some things up so
that the indicator can become more
optimized and efficient for our strategy
first in this tiles have we disabled the
macd in the signal options
because we won't be needing these two in
this strategy
next we move to the input section and
from there we change the fast length
option to 25 and the slow length to 100.
that's it
now we can click on the OK and close the
tab
let me explain how we will be using the
macd in our strategy
the way we use it is that whenever the
mac's histogram is above the zero line
it means that we're currently at an
uptrend movement and we're allowed to
enter only by trades
and if the histogram is under the zero
line it tells us that VR as a downtrend
movement and we should enter only short
or sell traits
let's see the indicator has worked with
the first one
here we got a bearish or sell signal and
if I draw a line exactly on this
Candlestick we can see that the macd
histogram is under the zero line
so we're currently at a descending Trend
and we are allowed to enter only cell
positions
so this signal is valid and we could
have entered a trade using it if we were
to do that and set our stop loss to here
we would have made a lot of profit
now let's move on to the next trade
see here we gotta Buy Signal
let's check it up using the macd
indicator and see if it is valid or not
here the macta's Instagram is completely
under the zero line
so that means we are at downtrend
movement and we are not allowed to enter
a Buy trade
so this signal here is fake and we
should ignore it and don't enter a trade
now the next signal is sell or bearish
that has been given by the first
indicator
I will draw a line here
see down here in the macting indicator
the histogram is still under the zero
line
so we are still at a downtrend movement
and we are allowed to open Short Selling
positions
we could have gained profit from this
trade as well
now let me show you some more examples
using this method
since it is always the best to trade
according to the Market's true momentum
I go to the indicators Tab and search
EMA and add the moving average
exponential indicator to my chart
by clicking on it we've got to change
some things in this indicator
in order to do that I will open EMA
settings tab by clicking on this gear
icon
in the settings I will change the length
to 200 from 9.
next in the style section change the
moving average line color to white and
make it a little Bolder so it can be
seen better
this moving average line actually shows
us the direction of the Market's trend
and if the price is higher than the
moving average line it means that the
trend of the market is upwards
and if the price is lower than the
moving average graph it says that the
trend of the market is downwards
we can enter a Buy trade whenever a Buy
Signal has been given by the first
indicator which is tradiexo
Here We Gotta Buy Signal and the second
condition is the Mac histogram being
above the zero line
but now we got a third condition as well
that is the price being higher than the
moving average 200 line
here our trigger Candlestick has been
closed exactly above the moving average
200 graph
so we are allowed to enter a Buy trade
now let's test a short trade and check
out its conditions
to enter a sell trade we have to get a
short or bearish signal from the trade
EXO indicator that we have got it here
next the macd histogram has got to be
under the zero line and in this position
the histogram is under the zero line
so the second condition is met as well
and for the third condition our Trader
Candlestick should close under the
moving average line and this is true
here so we can enter a short selling
entry
now that we've completely learned this
strategy I want to test it on the zos
chart with the 15 minutes time frame
and I want to see so how much profit we
could have made in these trades using
this strategy
now let's example
look this first trade win
and next this second Ed trade win
you can see here third trade also win
here for trade win and last trade hit
try get so easily make money form this
strategy
see how much profits it made with just
these five traits
in only five trades in the gold chart we
achieved nearly 312 profit
and this much profit in such food trade
is truly amazing and extraordinary
but if you want to know about another
great strategy that is just one make
sure to watch this next video shown on
the screen
see you soon
