hey guys and welcome in YouTube channel
in today's video I am going to tell you
about a really practical strategy in
financial markets
this strategy Works in all markets like
crypto Forex or stocks
and you can also use it in all time
frames from one minute to one hour
so make sure to watch this video Until
the End
for now I choose the Euro USD chart with
the one minute time frame
next I'm going to add the first
indicator to my chart chart
in order to do that I open the
indicators Tab and type utbot in the
search bar and add utbot alerts to my
chart okay
this is how this indicator looks
as you can see it's a very simple buy
and sell indicator that shows us the
exact price we should enter the trade
but using this indicator in its default
settings is not a good idea because it
gives out too many fake signals
but I want to show you some special
settings that eliminates almost all of
the false signals
so I open the utbot alert setting and in
the inputs tab I set key value to 4 and
I change the ATR period to 300.
next I go to the Styles section and
disable the cell option and close the
settings
because of these settings I just applied
to this indicator now I'm getting only
by signals
I have another special adjustment for
these cell signals that I am going to
Showcase ladder on Nvidia
working with this indicator is so simple
as soon as a Buy Signal is given on a
Candlestick you just need to open a
trading position
at that candlestick's closing price I
Mark the trigger Candlestick with a
vertical line
this is the kendallistic on which device
signal has been shown
and on its closing we can enter a trade
if I were to enter this trade I could
have gained a nice profit
see the next signal
here it is a Buy Signal
I enter a trade at the trigger
candlesticks closing and this trade
could also be profitable
or this example in the 15 minutes time
frame I could have gained two percent
profit from this trade alone
now let's add these cell signals to our
charts as well
so I open the indicators tab again and
add a second utbot alerts indicator to
my chart
I search utbot again and add this
indicator to my chart for a second time
to apply the cell adjustment to this
indicator I open its settings and inputs
I set the key value to 6 and the ATR
period to 1.
next up in the style tab I disable the
buy option so that it shows us only cell
signals
now in our charts we got both buy and
sell signals as we were entering trades
using these indicators by signals we can
use its cell signals to enter trades as
well
at the closing price of this
candlesticks on which the cell signal
has been displayed we can enter a cell
trade and another cell signal back here
here are some more examples in the Euro
USD chart with the one hour time frame

now for getting rid of the against and
momentum signals like this by signal
here which has been given in a
descending trend
and also in order to be able to identify
these signals and Trends I am going to
add the third indicator that is a trend
finder and an assistant for the
candlesticks to my chart
so I open the indicators Tab and type
linear regression candles in the search
bar and apply this indicator to my chart
the chart will change to look like this
and the candlesticks get smoother
to make the chart clearer
open the linear regression candle
settings in the style tab
change the Lin reg candle bullish
uncheck and Lynn reg candle bearish
uncheck
after going in the inputs tab
change the signal smoothing option from
11 to 200 and close the tab
yeah now we can see the smooth
candlesticks
we also need to optimize the moving
average line shown by this indicator
now this moving average shown is a
moving average 200.
adding this indicator to my chart is
going to help me identify the against
the momentum signal
whenever the candlesticks are below the
moving average 200 line I'm only allowed
to enter sell trades because we should
consider the trend which is downwards
and there's the opposite
as long as the canalistics are above the
moving averages 200 line I can only
enter by trades and trade according to
the momentum of the market which is
ascending
let's review the trade entry condition
again
we should enter a Buy trade when a Buy
Signal has been given by utbot alerts
like this one shown over here
then in order to confirm the signal
having the same directions as the true
momentum of the market we should be sure
that the candlestics are above the
moving average line
this Candlestick is above the moving
average 200 line and we have gotten a
Buy Signal on it
so this signal is confirmed and we can
use it to enter by trades
I enter a trade at this Connolly six
closing
I can set my stop loss below the
previous swing low
I adjust my stop loss according to the
swing low and for the Target I can use 1
over 1.5 risk reward ratio so I adjust
the take profit with a 1.5 reward ratio
for another example we gotta Buy Signal
here
the signal is above the moving average
line so it is valid and we can use it to
enter a trade
so I do open a trading position at these
candlestics closing
I set my stop loss below the last swing
low and adjust my target to one each to
five reward ratio
it is the exact opposite for sell trade
I just need a sell signal from utbot
alerts and the price should be below the
moving average 200 line to confirm the
signal
I entered the trade at this candle 6
closing setting my stop loss above the
last suing high and like by trade I set
a 1 over 1.5 risk reward ratio for
exiting the trade with using the moving
average 200 line
many fake signals like this by signal
and this other one here gets filtered
and it prevents us from entering a trade
against a market trend
now let's see how this trading setup
performs in gold chart history with the
one hour time frame
