oftentimes the simplest indicators can
give you very useful strategies for
scalp Trading
in this video I am going to show you one
such indicators
the macd indicator is widely popular and
used by experienced and inexperienced
Trader alike
the reason macd indicator is so popular
is because it is a trend following
momentum indicators
and as the saying goes in trading trend
is your friend
however macd is a very useful tool when
the market has a lot of price action
when the market is trading sideways the
macd indicator alone can produce a lot
of full signals
in this video I will show you how you
can use macd indicator along with some
other technical indicators to maximize
the profits
I will show you the strategy written in
Pine script and also the performance of
the strategy with strategy tester on
trading View

macd or moving average convergence
Divergence is a trend following
indicator
the macd indicator shows the
relationship between two exponential
moving average of a Securities price
although a Trader can set any two
exponential moving average periods the
commonly used moving average periods for
the macd indicator are 12 period EMA and
26 period EMA
the macd line is calculated by
subtracting the long term or the 26
period EMA from the short term or the 12
period EMA
the exponential moving average places
greater weight and significance on the
most recent data points
once you have the macd line then a nine
period EMA line is plotted on top of the
macd line
this line is called the signal line a
Trader can identify the market Trend by
looking at The Crossings of the signal
line and the macd line
a potential Buy Signal is when the macd
line crosses above the signal line and
the cell signal is when the macd line
crosses below the signal line
now let's script this simple macd
strategy and see how it performs
we will check the performance on sqq on
one hour chart

the strategy starts with an initial
capital of fifty thousand dollars and
the default quantity of trade is 100
which represents the order size
the macd indicator takes three inputs as
I said before the user can change the
input if they want but the default
values for the macd indicator are 12 and
26 period EMA to calculate the macd line
and 9 period EMA for the signal line
when applied the strategy on sqq we can
see a Buy Signal every time the macd
line crosses over the signal line
however if you look closely not every
trade ended in profit
the trade that ended with a stop loss
indicates the trade went against our
favor
by looking at the trades that failed and
the one succeeded an obvious pattern can
be observed
can you identify the pattern pause the
video now and comment why you think the
trades ended up the way they did
I hope you all got the right answer the
reason the strategy went against the
trader is because the entry was not
following the price trend
as you can see when the overall price
was trending down a Buy Signal ended up
in a loss
but when the strategy made a Buy Signal
with the price uptrend they all ended up
in profit
so it is important to trade with the
price trend one of the ways a price
trend can be tracked is with a longer
period exponential moving average
indicator
an exponential moving average is
different from the simple moving average
a simple moving average simply sums up
the closing prices of a specific period
and divides it by the number of periods
however the exponential moving average
calculates the multipliers for smoothing
the EMA
the multiplier or the smoothing factor
in the EMA is calculated by the
following formula
and this is the formula to calculate the
current EMA unlike the SMA which gives
all prices of the specified period and
equal weight EMA gives the recent prices
a higher weight
for this strategy we are using a 50
period EMA
however the value can be updated based
on the Trader's need
with the help of EMA it becomes more
clear which way the price is trending
anytime the price is closing above the
EMA line along with the EMA line moving
upwards it indicates an overall price
uptrend while price closing below the
EMA line with EMA line moving downwards
indicates a market downturn
it is also important to note that the
EMA line may not be the best trend
indicator when the price is moving
sideways
after we add the EMA indicator along
with our macd indicator let's look at
the changes in our strategy performance
adding the EMA line to track the market
Trend along with the macd indicator
anytime the price closes below the EMA
line the strategy ignores any bullish
crossover and avoids calling any buy
signals
only when the price was above the EMA
line a Buy Signal was triggered
as I have mentioned before both the EMA
line and the macd indicators give full
signals when the price is moving
sideways
without making the strategy too complex
we can add an additional check to avoid
some of the buy signals that are too
close to the EMA line
we want the Buy Signal to be triggered
when there is a clear Trend in the EMA
line
but when the price is too close to the
EMA line we cannot be sure about the
price trend
so until the price in the EMA line has a
certain difference between them the Buy
Signal will not be triggered
now putting all these together the
complete script can automatically
trigger the Buy Signal along with the
appropriate take profit and the stop
loss level
in this case we are using a one percent
profit Target and stop loss at a
one-to-one ratio
let's quickly code this up

this strategy on sqq on a one-hour chart
the strategy produced over 90 win rate
and a net gain of more than 30 since
2020. obviously this strategy is not
perfect and there is a lot of room for
improvement
you should not use this strategy in your
trading without understanding properly
how this strategy works on your
instrument
regardless this simple strategy when
applied properly can bring big profits
in your Trading
