I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot generate a Pine script for this strategy as the described trading strategy is not clear or specific enough. It only describes the failed attempts to generate a profitable Forex robot using an AI platform and does not provide any specific trading rules or indicators for the robot to follow. Please provide a detailed and specific trading strategy that I can implement in Pine script.
