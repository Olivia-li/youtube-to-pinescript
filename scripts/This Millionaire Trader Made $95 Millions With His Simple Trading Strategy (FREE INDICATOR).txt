I'm sorry, but I cannot create a Pine script based on the given strategy as it requires additional information and specific indicators that are not described in detail. Please provide me with a more detailed and complete summary of the strategy, including the exact parameters and settings for each indicator, as well as any additional rules for trade entries and exits.
