In this video, the presenter shares their ultimate trading strategy using three indicators: Signs of the Time Indicator, Twin Range Filter Indicator, and Exponential Moving Average. The presenter suggests setting the time frame to 15 minutes and using the Signs of the Time Indicator to determine the market trend. A green color indicates an uptrend, and a red color indicates a downtrend. The Twin Range Filter Indicator helps filter out false signals, and the Exponential Moving Average helps traders identify buying and selling opportunities. The presenter demonstrates how to use the three indicators together to make accurate trades. They provide examples of both buying and selling setups and suggest setting a stop loss and a 1.5 risk to reward ratio. Overall, the presenter claims that this strategy can be used to double, triple, or even quadruple an account size in a matter of weeks.
