In this video, the presenter shares a simple yet profitable trading strategy using three free indicators on the TradingView website. The first indicator is the Trader XO micro Trend scanner, which contains two moving average graphs. The buy and sell signals are based on the crossing of these two lines. The strategy involves entering a trade when a bullish or long signal appears, and the candlesticks form simultaneously with the signal being above the two lines. The opposite is true for sell signals. The second indicator is the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which is used to filter out fake signals. The third indicator is the Moving Average Exponential (EMA), which shows the direction of the market's trend. The strategy involves entering a trade when a buy or sell signal is given by the Trader XO indicator, the MACD histogram is above or below the zero line, and the price is higher or lower than the moving average 200 line. The presenter demonstrates the strategy on the Zoos currency pair with a 15-minute time frame and shows how it can be profitable with just a few trades.
