In this video, the presenter shares a simple yet profitable trading strategy using three free indicators on TradingView.com. The first indicator is Trader XO Micro Trend Scanner which contains two moving average graphs. Trading signals are based on the crossing of these two lines. A bullish or buy signal is given if the crossing is upwards, while a bearish or sell signal is given if the crossing is downwards. The strategy is to enter a trade when a bullish or long signal appears simultaneously with the candlestick being above the two lines. For a sell signal, the opposite conditions apply. The second indicator used is the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which is used to filter out fake signals. A third indicator, the Moving Average Exponential (EMA) indicator, is used to show the direction of the market's trend. The strategy is to enter a buy trade when a buy signal is given, the MACD histogram is above the zero line, and the price is higher than the moving average 200 line. For a sell trade, the opposite conditions apply. The presenter demonstrates the strategy on the ZOS chart with a 15-minute time frame and shows how profitable it can be.
