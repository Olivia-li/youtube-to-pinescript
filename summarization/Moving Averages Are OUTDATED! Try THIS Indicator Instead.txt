Moving averages are known for their simplicity and predictiveness in the markets, but the classical exponential moving average (EMA) is a lagging indicator, resulting in missed opportunities. The new zero lag EMA is at least three times better than classical EMAs because it gives an early entry signal. This indicator can be found on TradingView and is used to identify trends in the market and buy/sell entry signals. To take a long trade, the three Z EMAs should be spread apart with a blue one at the bottom, red in the center, and green at the top. Wait for the price to pull back and touch the red line without touching the blue line, then enter a long trade on the open of the next candle. Set the stop loss below the most recent swing low and the take profit at 2.5 times the risk. For a short trade, reverse the conditions. This is a simple yet powerful indicator that can be used on any trading security and any time frame. Customization and extensive testing are recommended for optimal results.
