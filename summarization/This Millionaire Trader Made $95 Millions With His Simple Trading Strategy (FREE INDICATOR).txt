The video is about a trading strategy that uses two free Trading View indicators and works well on shorter time frames such as one and five minutes. The first indicator is the RSI adaptive indicator, also known as the R-squared adapt indicator, and the second is the rsqrd adapt Fischer transform with d-zones and divs. The strategy involves placing a buy order when the gkyz filtered indicator gives a buy signal, the adapt Fischer indicator is green, and the market forms a bullish candle. The stop loss is placed at the low of the RSI green line, and the risk to reward ratio is 1:1.5. The same process is followed for placing a sell order when the gkyz filtered indicator gives a sell signal, the adapt Fischer indicator is red, and the market forms a bearish candle. The stop loss is placed at the high of the RSI red line, and the risk to reward ratio is 1:1.5. The video also includes examples of trades using this strategy.
