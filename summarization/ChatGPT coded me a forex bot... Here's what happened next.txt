Chat GPT is an AI platform that has taken the internet by storm. It can write pretty much anything in seconds, from an ancient Chinese poem to a 30-minute dumbbell workout. However, the question is, can it write code for a Forex robot that can make money? In this video, the presenter shows the results of his experiment with Chat GPT. He asked it to write MQL5 code for a Forex expert advisor to trade on MetaTrader5, using a trend-following strategy. The AI wrote the code in less than 30 seconds, but unfortunately, it didn't work. The presenter then hired someone on Fiverr to clean up the code and make it operational. He then tested the expert advisor on MetaTrader5 and found that it didn't work either. He tried optimizing the code, but still, nothing turned a profit. The presenter concludes that while Chat GPT is efficient at writing code, the philosophy and logic of coding an EA that will make money are not quite there yet. However, he believes that it may be possible in the near future.
