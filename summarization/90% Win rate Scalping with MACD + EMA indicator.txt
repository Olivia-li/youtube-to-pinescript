The MACD indicator is a popular trend-following momentum indicator used by traders of all levels. It shows the relationship between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) of a security's price. The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA, and a nine-period EMA line is plotted on top of the MACD line to identify potential buy and sell signals. However, the MACD indicator alone can produce false signals when the market is trading sideways. To maximize profits, traders can use the MACD indicator along with other technical indicators such as the exponential moving average (EMA) to track the market trend. When the price is closing above the EMA line with the EMA line moving upwards, it indicates an overall price uptrend, and when the price is closing below the EMA line with the EMA line moving downwards, it indicates a market downturn. By adding the EMA indicator along with the MACD indicator, traders can avoid false signals and maximize profits. A complete script can automatically trigger the buy signal along with the appropriate take profit and stop loss level. This simple strategy has produced over a 90% win rate and a net gain of more than 30% since 2020. However, traders should not use this strategy without understanding how it works on their instrument.
