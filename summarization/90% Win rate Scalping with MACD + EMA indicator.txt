In this video, the presenter explains how to use the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator for scalp trading. MACD is a trend following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two exponential moving averages of a security's price. The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the long-term (26 period) EMA from the short-term (12 period) EMA. A nine period EMA line is then plotted on top of the MACD line, and a trader can identify the market trend by looking at the crossings of the signal line and the MACD line. A potential buy signal is when the MACD line crosses above the signal line, and a sell signal is when the MACD line crosses below the signal line.

The presenter shows a simple MACD strategy written in Pine script and its performance with strategy tester on Trading View. The strategy starts with an initial capital of $50,000 and uses the default values for the MACD indicator (12 and 26 period EMA to calculate the MACD line and 9 period EMA for the signal line). The strategy produces a buy signal every time the MACD line crosses over the signal line, but not every trade ends in profit. The trades that failed did so because the entry was not following the price trend. It is important to trade with the price trend, and one way to track the trend is with a longer period exponential moving average indicator (50 period EMA in this case).

The presenter adds the EMA indicator to the MACD indicator to track the market trend, and the strategy only triggers a buy signal when the price is above the EMA line. The complete script can automatically trigger the buy signal along with the appropriate take profit and stop loss levels. The strategy produced over a 90% win rate and a net gain of more than 30% since 2020. However, traders should not use this strategy without understanding how it works on their instrument.
